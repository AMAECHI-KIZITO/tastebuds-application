# Tastebuds.. Your Tongue's Best Buddy
A food-listing application that allows restaurants/food-vendors list their products (whether having their own applications or not) in a bid to further enhance their reach and customer awareness. It is powered to be an API interactive platform whereby products are listed by connecting to the api endpoints created. Endpoints (API) also exist for the updating of product price, image, description, category etc. As the project progresses, payment options would be built to allow ease of business for both sellers and buyers. Orders for each vendor can also be gotten daily by connecting to the endpoint designed for it. Businesses lacking the capacity to utilize the end points would have personalized CRUD portals for them created.
